# ANIMAL-CLASSIFICATION-MODEL


# Animal Detection using Deep Learning (Work in Progress)

This project aims to develop an accurate and efficient deep learning model for animal detection and classification. The model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and is trained on the Animals Detection Images Dataset, which contains images of cats, dogs, birds, and horses in various backgrounds and lighting conditions. The goal of the model is to automatically identify and classify animals in new images, which can be applied to various applications such as wildlife conservation, pet care, and animal surveillance.

The project includes the following components:
- Data exploration and preprocessing: The Animals Detection Images Dataset is explored and preprocessed to prepare it for training the deep learning model. Currently, we are working on fine-tuning the parameters and addressing the issue of label encoding unequal classes.
- Model development and training: A deep learning model based on CNNs is developed and trained on the preprocessed dataset to achieve high accuracy and efficiency. Currently, the model is being trained on a GPU to speed up the process.
- Model evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance and identify potential areas for improvement.
- Model deployment: The trained model will be deployed using Flask, a web framework for building web applications in Python. The Flask app will allow users to upload an image and receive a prediction of the animal in the image using the trained model.


# still a work in progress!!
